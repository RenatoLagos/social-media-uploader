🌍 I'm learning German from scratch in Berlin — and here's what it taught me about YOUR Spanish journey

As a Spanish teacher now living in Germany, I know exactly how you feel learning a new language.

👉 Not understanding anything around you
👉 Feeling left out even when you speak English
👉 Starting from zero without knowing how to say "hello"

💡 My advice from a polyglot I once heard: Fall in love with the language. Don't just study it because you have to — make it part of your life.

🔹 Listen to a song in Spanish
🔹 Watch a video in Spanish
🔹 Learn 3 verbs and repeat them all day
🔹 Read a book — even just a little

The key? Study every day, even if it's just a little. Don't let go of Spanish. Make it part of who you are.

🔤 L vs LL — They sound COMPLETELY different in Spanish! 👇

You know the Spanish L, right? Easy: lago, lavandería, limón.

But when you see TWO L's together? The sound changes completely!

👉 LL sounds like the English Y:
🔹 Llama
🔹 Llaves
🔹 Llamar
🔹 Lluvia

💡 Fun fact: LL used to be its own letter in the Spanish alphabet! Now it's just a combination, but the unique sound remains.

⚠️ Regional variations you should know:

🔹 Most of Latin America → LL sounds like a soft Y
lluvia, ellos, calle

🔹 Argentina & Uruguay → LL sounds more like SH/CH
lluvia → "shoo-vee-ah"

This is called yeísmo — and it's totally normal! You'll hear both pronunciations depending on where someone is from.

TITLE: 📝 Where does the adjective go in Spanish? After the noun! 👇

DESCRIPTIONS:

In English you say "big house" — but in Spanish, it's the opposite:

👉 casa grande (big house)
👉 perro negro (black dog)
👉 agua fría (cold water)
👉 comida buena (good food)
👉 libro interesante (interesting book)

❌ NOT "grande casa" or "negro perro"

🔹 The adjective must MATCH the noun:
➡️ Masculine/Feminine: perro negro → casa negra
➡️ Singular/Plural: perro negro → perros negros

💡 This word order actually helps you understand Spanish better — first you know WHAT it is, then you learn HOW it is: coche... rojo (car... red)

✅ For beginners: always use noun + adjective. You'll never be wrong!
